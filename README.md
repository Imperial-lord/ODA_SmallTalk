# ðŸ¤– ODA Small Talk Skill

This is a community maintained Oracle Digital Assistant Skill. 

## Install

Clone, zip contents and import into ODA as a skill.  
If you download as a zip make sure to extract first and re-zip... 
as the root folder will be the name of the project - you will need to remove this so that the root content items are the chatbot skill data items.

## ODA Bot Config

Exit Prompt Confidence Threshold = 0  
Interrupt Prompt Confidence Threshold = 0
